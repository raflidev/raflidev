Hello, I am Rafli Ramadhan, diligently creating a microblog on my Instagram [@raflidev](https://instagram.com/raflidev). Microblog with web tutorial content. Now, I'm focusing on creating an online classroom platform at [@sekolahdigital](https://github.com/sekolahdigital), there is a YouTube channel as well as a [Sekolah Digital](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgt-sNzkXmyuRtoitRUo60g) and I will be one of the mentors there.

I am also happy to be able to make podcasts on [Kotak IT](https://kotakitpodcast.xyz/) with chat content and Internet Things and interesting technology news. In the future, kotakIT has a blog and hopefully it will be realized.
